# TicTactoe
Simple Tic Tac Toe game using C

âœ…How It Works:
The board is a 3x3 array initialized with spaces.
Players X and O take turns by entering row and column numbers (1 to 3).
The game checks after each move for:
A win condition (rows, columns, diagonals).
A draw condition (when 9 moves are made and no one wins).
The game clears the screen (system("clear")), redraws the board after each move.
On Windows, replace system("clear") with system("cls").
